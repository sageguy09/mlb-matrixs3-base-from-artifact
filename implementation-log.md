# MLB Scoreboard Implementation Log - Update

## Improvements Made

Based on the detailed analysis, I've implemented several key improvements to the MLB Scoreboard project:

### 1. Improved Layout Configuration

- Updated the `/layouts/w64h32.json` configuration file with optimized positions
- Added separate positioning for home team, versus text, and away team elements
- Repositioned the base diamond for better visibility
- Added support for logo size constraints (`max_width` and `max_height`)

### 2. Enhanced Base Diamond Visualization

- Improved the pixel-based diamond with better positioning
- Optimized the line-drawing algorithm between bases
- Added boundary checking to prevent out-of-range pixel assignments
- Used configurable colors for active/inactive bases from layout file
- Better spacing between bases for improved visibility

### 3. Added MLB Startup Logo

- Implemented a new startup sequence with centered MLB logo
- Added version information display during startup
- Implemented a fallback text display if the logo isn't available
- Added a startup delay to allow users to see the logo (3 seconds)

### 4. Modular Code Structure

- Created separate functions for different display components:
  - `load_layout_config()` - Load and parse JSON configuration
  - `show_mlb_startup_logo()` - Display startup sequence
  - `create_base_diamond()` - Create the base runner visualization
  - `setup_game_day_display()` - Put together all display elements
- Added robust error handling for each component
- Added memory management with garbage collection

### 5. Debugging Tools

- Added a `print_layout_grid()` function to visualize the layout positions
- Included memory usage reporting
- Better error messages for each component

## Pixel Mapping Optimization

The layout has been configured for optimal visibility on a 64x32 LED matrix. Key optimizations include:

1. **Team Logo**: Positioned at (2,2) with size constraints (max 24x24 pixels)
2. **Team Matchup**: Spread across the top with clear separation between elements:
   - Home team at (28,4)
   - "v" text at (38,4)
   - Away team at (47,4)
3. **Base Diamond**: Centered in the display area with proper scaling:
   - Home plate at (39,18)
   - First base at (44,13)
   - Second base at (39,8)
   - Third base at (34,13)
4. **Count Information**: Positioned at (50,18) to avoid overlap with the diamond
5. **Score Display**: Clear position at the bottom (28,26)

## Next Steps

1. **API Integration**: Implement ESPN API integration for live data
2. **Off-Day Layout**: Create an alternate layout for when no games are scheduled
3. **Team Logo Handling**: Add proper logo resizing for different teams
4. **Multi-Screen Support**: Implement screen rotation for additional information
5. **Layout Tuning**: Fine-tune pixel positions based on actual display testing

## Technical Notes

- The implementation now aligns with the reference MLB-LED-Scoreboard project
- Base diamond visualization is properly implemented with lines connecting bases
- The layout system allows easy adjustment without code changes
- Memory management has been improved through strategic garbage collection
- Error handling is in place for all display components

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the MLB Scoreboard project and addresses the key issues identified in the analysis.
