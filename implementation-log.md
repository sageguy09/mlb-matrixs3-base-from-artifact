# MLB Scoreboard Implementation Log

## Project Analysis and Implementation

This document tracks the implementation of the Atlanta Braves MLB Scoreboard for a 64x32 RGB LED matrix using the Adafruit MatrixPortal S3. The project has been implemented based on the requirements from the prompt and analysis documents.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Created Layout Configuration System

- Created the `/layouts` directory
- Implemented the `w64h32.json` layout configuration file
- Added configuration-based layout system in `code.py`
- Added robust error handling for configuration loading

### 2. Updated Settings Configuration

- Updated `settings.toml` to align with project requirements
- Streamlined configuration focusing on:
  - WiFi settings
  - Display settings
  - MLB team settings
  - Debug options

### 3. Implemented Pixel-Based Base Diamond

- Replaced text-based base indicators with a pixel-based diamond visualization
- Implemented diamond drawing with configurable colors and positions
- Created lines connecting the bases for better visibility
- Made the base colors configurable via the layout file

### 4. Refactored Display Elements for Configuration

- All display elements now pull their position from the layout configuration
- Colors are now defined in the layout configuration file
- Added proper error handling around each display element

### 5. Added Memory Management

- Added garbage collection after display updates
- Added memory usage reporting for debugging

## Technical Details

### Base Diamond Visualization

The base diamond implementation uses a custom bitmap with multiple colors:
- Each base is represented as a pixel at the configured position
- The bases are connected with lines to form a diamond shape
- Occupied bases are highlighted with the configured "color_on" value
- Empty bases are displayed with the configured "color_off" value

### Layout Configuration System

The layout configuration uses a JSON file that defines:
- x, y coordinates for each display element
- Color values for each element
- Base positions and colors for the diamond visualization

### Future Integration Points

The code includes placeholder comments for future ESPN API integration. The next steps would be:
- Implement network connectivity
- Add ESPN API data fetching
- Create an off-day layout and configuration
- Implement automatic mode switching based on game schedule

## Memory Optimization

The implementation includes several memory optimization techniques:
- Using garbage collection after display operations
- Error handling to prevent crashes on failed asset loading
- Using a single main display group with components added dynamically
- Minimizing string operations

## Testing Notes

The implementation has been tested with static game data. The diamond base visualization works correctly, showing the proper base occupation status.

## Next Steps

1. Implement ESPN API integration for live game data
2. Create off-day screen layout and configuration
3. Add support for different matrix sizes
4. Implement automatic mode switching based on game schedule
