# MLB Scoreboard Implementation Log - Size Optimization Update

## Size Optimization Changes

Based on our analysis of the display requirements, we've implemented several key improvements to optimize the layout for better readability and information density:

### 1. Reduced Logo Size

- Changed the team logo from 24x24 to 15x15 pixels
- Updated the logo area border to 17x17 to accommodate the smaller logo
- Modified the `get_team_logos.py` script to download and resize images to 15x15
- Adjusted logo positioning within its bordered area

### 2. Text Size Standardization

- Set the main game text to a standardized 7-pixel height
- Used scale=1 for all text elements to ensure consistent sizing
- Adjusted all text element positions to align with the new sizing

### 3. Improved Layout Spacing

- Repositioned all display elements to make better use of the available space
- Increased horizontal spacing between elements for improved readability
- Moved the base diamond to better utilize the right side of the display
- Repositioned count display to the bottom center for better visibility

### 4. Base Diamond Optimization

- Reduced base indicator size from 3x3 to 2x2 pixels to match the smaller scale
- Adjusted the diamond shape to be proportional to the new layout
- Optimized base positioning for better visibility

### 5. Color Scheme Maintenance

- Kept the established color scheme for consistency
- Maintained high contrast between elements for readability

## Layout Visualization

The optimized layout follows this approximate pattern:

## Memory Impact

The reduced image size and optimized display elements have resulted in memory savings:
- Smaller BMP image (15x15 vs 24x24) reduces memory usage
- Consistent text scaling eliminates the need for multiple font sizes
- Smaller base diamond visualization requires less bitmap memory

## Next Steps

These optimizations provide a solid foundation for future enhancements:
1. Run the updated `get_team_logos.py` script to generate the 15x15 ATL.bmp logo
2. Test the display with the new layout configurations
3. Fine-tune positions if needed based on actual display results
4. Continue with ESPN API integration as originally planned

The optimized layout maintains all the required information while making better use of the limited 64x32 pixel display space.
